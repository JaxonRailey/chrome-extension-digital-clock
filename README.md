# Chrome Extension Digital Clock

With this repo I want to show how easy it is to create an extension for Chromium based browsers. To load the extension in your browser, type **chrome://extensions** in the address bar, click on **Load unpacked**, the classic folder navigation window will appear, then enter the project folder and confirm.

Browser extensions need the **manifest.json** file, make sure this file is in the root of the folder, next to the **index.html** file.

:star: **If you liked what I did, if it was useful to you or if it served as a starting point for something more magical let me know with a star** :green_heart:
